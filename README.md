# sitemap

Clojure library for generating sitemaps.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hashobject/sitemap.png)](https://travis-ci.org/hashobject/sitemap)

Sitemaps XML format described on [http://www.sitemaps.org/](http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html).

Sitemap library accepts Clojure datastructure and produces sitemap XML as string.

Optionally sitemap XML can be saved to file using provided path.

Input data structure should be in the following format:

```clojure
[
  {:loc "http://hashobject.com/about"
   :lastmod "2013-05-31"
   :changefreq "monthly"
   :priority "0.8"}
  {:loc "http://hashobject.com/team"
   :lastmod "2013-06-01"
   :changefreq "monthly"
   :priority "0.9"}]
```

So it should be sequence of hash maps. Each map should have following keys:

  * loc - url to the page
  * lastmod - date when page was modified in YYYY-MM-DD format
  * changefreq - how often page content will be changed (daily, weekly, monthly, never)
  * priority - what is the priority of this page on the site (from 0 to 1)


Note that only 'loc' key is mandatory.

Please refer to documentation for values' formats of each key.

                         :changefreq "monthly"
                         :priority "0.8"}
                        {:loc "http://hashobject.com/team"
                         :lastmod "2013-06-01"
                         :changefreq "monthly"
                         :priority "0.9"}])
"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>
<urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\">
  <url>
    <loc>http://hashobject.com/about</loc>
    <lastmod>2013-05-31</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.8</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>http://hashobject.com/team</loc>
    <lastmod>2013-06-01</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.9</priority>
  </url>
</urlset>"
```

## Tips

We recommend you to validate sitemap before submitting it to Google Webmaster tools.
There are plenty of online validators. Maybe we will later add validation support to this library.
