# sitemap

Clojure library for generating sitemaps.

Sitemaps XML format described on [http://www.sitemaps.org/](http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html).

Sitemap library accepts Clojure datastructure and produces sitemap XML as string.

Optionally sitemap XML can be saved to file using provided path.

Input data structure should be in the following format:

```
[
  {:loc "http://hashobject.com/about"
   :lastmod "2013-05-31"
   :changefreq "monthly"
   :priority "0.8"}
  {:loc "http://hashobject.com/team"
   :lastmod "2013-06-01"
   :changefreq "monthly"
   :priority "0.9"}]
```

So it should be sequence of hash maps. Each map should have following keys: loc, lastmod,
changefreq, priority. Only `loc` key is mandatory.

Please refer to documentation for values' formats of each key.

## Tips

We recommend you validate sitemap before submitting it to Google Webmaster tools.
There are plenty of online validators.
